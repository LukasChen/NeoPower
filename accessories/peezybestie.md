We all know that putting on a effective shaper could be a challenge.
Sometimes we might need some of our best friends to lend a hand or two. 
PeezyBestie, your personal  shapewear assistant. This is how you do itï¼š

- Close the shaper well before using it (if there is a closure).
- Step in and pull up your PeezyBestie.
- Step in your shaper & pull up till the shaper pass the hips.
- Pull down and step out your PeezyBestie or pull it up off your body and give your shaper an quick adjust. Voila! Easy Peezy. 
- Perfect accessory for using all shape wear, especially all corsets, vests and shapers without closure. 

Human skin naturally creates a frictional force, which can make
wearing tight garments like shapers a struggle. PeezyBestie is made 
of specially engineered material, highly elastic and super smooth.
Creates a slick medium between your skin and the shaper. The shaper 
glides over it like bird over the wind, and can be taken off in a blink of 
eyes.
